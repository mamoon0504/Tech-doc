    "# Assignment: Clustering Movies with Numerical Features and One-Hot Encoded Genres\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use K-means clustering to group movies based on both numerical attributes (e.g., ratings, duration) and their genres. By combining these two types of features, you will create clusters of movies that share similar characteristics, both in terms of numerical values and genre. The dataset you’ll be working with is derived from IMDb, one of the most comprehensive online databases for movies. This dataset includes various attributes of movies, such as titles, genres, ratings, release years, durations, and potentially other features like budget and revenue. \n",

    "1. Load and Explore the Dataset\n",
    "2. Clean the Dataset\n",
    "3. Select and Standardize Numerical Features\n",
    "4. One-Hot Encode the Genre Column. For one-hot encoding of genres, check if each movie has multiple genres listed in one cell. You may need to split these genres and then apply one-hot encoding.\n",

    "6. Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters\n",
    "7. Apply K-means Clustering\n",
