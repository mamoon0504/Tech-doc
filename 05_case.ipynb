    "# 📰 The News Framing of Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "In this notebook you will reproduce a part of the work done by [Nguyen and Hekman (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-022-01511-1) on how media discourses make sense of automation. Authors collected A.I.-related news content from four different (tech-)news outlets that publish in English: The New York Times, The Guardian, Wired, and Gizmodo. Relevant news content was retrieved via search requests for the keywords “A.I.”, “AI”, and “artificial intelligence”. Only articles in which these terms occurred at least twice in the body text or once in the title or short metadata description were included in the final dataset of 3,098 unique items. The timeframe for the analysis spans from January 2010 to May 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various methods were used and in this notebook you will use:\n",
    "1. Text Pre-processing\n",
    "2. Bag-of-Words (not directly used in the study)\n",
    "3. N-grams (not used in the study, so let's see if results will vary)\n",
    "4. TF-IDF\n",
    "5. K-means clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the knowledge and skills obtained from the previous notebooks and analyse the corpus of text."
