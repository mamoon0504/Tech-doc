    "# Introduction to Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore **clustering**, a technique in unsupervised machine learning used to group similar data points together without predefined labels. Clustering allows us to discover patterns and structure within our data by organizing it into distinct groups, or *clusters*, based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering has a wide range of applications, including:\n",
    "- **User Segmentation**: Designers can identify different groups of users with similar preferences and behaviors, allowing for more options such as personalization.\n",
    "- **Image Segmentation**: In computer vision, clustering is often used to distinguish between different parts of an image, making it easier to process or analyze.\n",
    "- **Document Classification**: In Natural Language Processing (NLP), clustering can be used to organize large collections of documents by grouping similar content together, aiding in information retrieval and topic discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### K-means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of $k$-means clustering is to partition $n$ data points into $k$ clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance. Here’s the mathematical formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{x \\in C_i} \\| x - \\mu_i \\|^2\n",
    "$$]=\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Where:\n",
    "   - $J$ is the total within-cluster sum of squares, which $k$-means seeks to minimize.\n",
    "   - $k$ is the number of clusters.\n",
    "   - $C_i$ is the set of points in the $i$-th cluster.\n",
    "   - $x$ is a data point in cluster $C_i$.\n",
    "   - $mu_i$ is the centroid of cluster $C_i$, defined as the mean of the points in $C_i$:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     mu_i = \\frac{1}{|C_i|} \\sum_{x \\in C_i} x\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - $ \\| x - \\mu_i \\|^2 $ is the squared Euclidean distance between point $x$ and the centroid $mu_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithm Steps**:\n",
    "   - **Initialize**: Choose $ k $ initial centroids randomly from the data points.\n",
    "   - **Assignment Step**: For each point $ x $, assign it to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance, thus forming $ k $ clusters.\n",
    "   - **Update Step**: Recalculate the centroid of each cluster as the mean of all points assigned to that cluster.\n",
    "   - **Repeat**: Iterate the assignment and update steps until convergence (when the assignments no longer change or the centroids stop moving significantly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this iterative optimization, $ k $-means clustering tries to find cluster centers $ \\mu_i $ that minimize the sum of squared distances $ J $, effectively minimizing the variance within each cluster."
